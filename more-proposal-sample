    "name": "Robert - HubSpot Google Map UI Extension",
    "content": "Hello,\n Please pay attention to my proposal. I have real experience in HubSpot UI Extension\n development.\n One of the extensions I developed is called HubSpotGoogleMapSetCoodinatesExtension.\n Here you can find a code snippet.- https://gist.github.com/Robertdom0826/2aef3f70eb7136d39857beadff51b19f\n The company I worked for is a real estate related company. They take home leads from the\n 3rd party or home owners.\n The leads contains a rough Lang and Long data. However, they were not accurate.\n They wanted to verify the lang/long info. So far, the team members checked the lang/long\n and then check it on Google Map, and then if it's not correct they find the real lang/long and then put them into HubSpot contacts.\n However, the process was very time consuming. That's why they wanted to develop a UI\n extension that opens a popup with existing lang/long and then if it's not correct, they can set points on the google map embedded inside the popup and then by clicking a button simply wanted to update the existing contact.\n I developed the app from scratch, and built it successfully.\n I hope that helps you understand my real experience in HubSpot UI Extension development.\n Please contact me and let's discuss more details over chat.\n Best regards,\n Robert"
